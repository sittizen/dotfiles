## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @docs/*.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- DO NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- Once loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed
- ALWAYS give feedback on having loaded external files

## Planning Guidelines
Before doing any plan load this file relative to project root: @docs/systemPatterns.md

## Agent Feedback
When you encounter something in the project that surprises / confuses you, give feedback to the user working with you, and indicate the case updating the file @docs/encounteredProblems.md, to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.
