## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @docs/*.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- DO NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- Once loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed
- ALWAYS give feedback on having loaded external files

## Planning Guidelines
Before doing any plan load this file relative to project root: @docs/systemPatterns.md

## Building Guidelines
Before writing the implementation code load this file relative to project root: @docs/techContext.md
